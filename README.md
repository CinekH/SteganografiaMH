This project was created as an example of selected steganography method. Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data to avoid detection. 
Application gives the user possibilities to encrypt data (text or image) inside the picture selected by him. There is obviously an option to decrypt 
the hidden message. Also there are involved some functions for users, for example saving encrypted image in database. My Engineer's Thesis was based 
on this project, entitled "Hidding data using steganography techniques". https://steganografiaherman.netlify.app/
